# Chat-RPC - Centralized Chat with Concept RPC (Java)



Chat-RPC is a centralized chat application built using the concept of Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) in Java. It allows users to connect to a central server and engage in real-time chat with other connected users. This project is designed to demonstrate the implementation of RPC in Java and provide a simple, yet functional, centralized chat system.

## Introduction

The Chat-RPC project is aimed at showcasing the principles of Remote Procedure Calls in the context of a centralized chat application. The server-client architecture allows multiple users to connect to a central server, where they can exchange messages with each other. RPC facilitates communication between the clients and the server by invoking remote methods, making the chat interactions seamless and efficient.

## Features

- Centralized chat server facilitating multiple clients.
- Real-time message exchange among connected clients.
- Efficient communication using the RPC concept.
- Simple and easy-to-understand codebase for educational purposes.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to get the Chat-RPC project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher installed on your system.
- Git installed for cloning the repository from GitHub.
- A Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.) or a text editor for code editing.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Barok-Getachew/chat-rpc.git


2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE or text editor.

3. Build the project to ensure all dependencies are resolved.

## Usage

1. **Start the server:**
   - Locate the `ServerMain` class in the project.
   - Run the `main` method to start the chat server.

2. **Start the client:**
   - Locate the `ClientMain` class in the project.
   - Run the `main` method to start the chat client.

3. Upon starting the client, you will be prompted to provide a username.

4. Once connected to the server, you can exchange messages with other connected clients.

5. To exit the chat, simply type `/exit` or close the client window.
