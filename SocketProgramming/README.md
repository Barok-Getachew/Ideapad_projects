# Socket Programming Project

This project is a simple demonstration of Socket Programming in Java. It consists of two classes: a Server class and a Client class.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download JDK from the official website:

- [Java SE Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)

To get a copy of this project, you can clone it from GitHub using the following command:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/socket-programming-project.git â†—
```
## Usage

### Server Class

To start the server, open a terminal window, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command:
- javac Server.java
- java Server
This will start the server and bind it to a default IP address and port number. You can modify the IP address and port number by changing the values in the `HOST` and `PORT` variables at the top of the `Server.java` script.

### Client Class

To start the client, open another [terminal window](poe://www.poe.com/_api/key_phrase?phrase=terminal%20window&prompt=Tell%20me%20more%20about%20terminal%20window.), navigate to the project directory, and run the following command:
- javac Client.java
- java Client
This will connect the client to the server and allow you to send messages from the client to the server. You can modify the IP address and port number by changing the values in the `HOST` and `PORT` variables at the top of the `Client.java` script.
